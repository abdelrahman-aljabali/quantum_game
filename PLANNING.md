# PLANNING.md

## 🎯 High-Level Vision
Implement a blockchain-based "2/3 Average Game" where 3+ players submit numbers (0-1000) and the winner is closest to 2/3 of the average. Built in Solidity with a React DApp interface for a university blockchain course assignment.

**Current Status:** ✅ Core implementation complete, needs tests + documentation
**Time to completion:** ~2 hours

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview (IMPLEMENTED)

### Smart Contracts (Solidity ^0.8.20)
- **GameFactory.sol** ✅
  - Factory pattern implementation
  - Creates TwoThirdsAverageGame instances
  - Service fee collection for contract owner
- **TwoThirdsAverageGame.sol** ✅
  - Complete game lifecycle management
  - Commit-reveal pattern for fairness
  - Phase transitions: Waiting → Starting → Commit → Reveal → Results → Ended
  - Pull-over-push withdrawal pattern

### Frontend (React + TypeScript) ✅
- **EthereumContext:** Web3 integration with ethers.js v6
- **GameInterface:** Main game UI with phase visualization
- **PlayerPortal:** Player status and actions
- **NumberSelector:** Commit-reveal interface
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS + Radix UI components

---

## 🧩 Game Mechanics (IMPLEMENTED)

| Phase | Functionality | Status |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Waiting | Players join by paying entry fee | ✅ |
| Starting | Countdown before commit phase | ✅ |
| Commit | Players submit hash(number + salt) | ✅ |
| Reveal | Players reveal original number + salt | ✅ |
| Results | Calculate 2/3 average, determine winner | ✅ |
| Ended | Distribute prizes, allow withdrawals | ✅ |

**Security Features:** Commit-reveal, ReentrancyGuard, early exit handling, fair randomness for ties

## 💻 Tech Stack (CURRENT)

| Layer | Implementation | Status |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| Smart Contracts | Solidity ^0.8.20, OpenZeppelin | ✅ |
| Blockchain | Hardhat local network | ✅ |
| Frontend | React + TypeScript + Vite | ✅ |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + Radix UI | ✅ |
| Web3 | ethers.js v6 | ✅ |
| Testing | **MISSING** | ❌ |
| Documentation | **INCOMPLETE** | ❌ |

## 🚨 Critical Missing Components (2 Hour Sprint)

### Priority 1: Unit Tests (60 minutes)
```javascript
// test/GameFactory.test.js
- Factory deployment and game creation
- Owner permissions and service fees
- Default parameter validation

// test/TwoThirdsAverageGame.test.js  
- Player joining (success/failure scenarios)
- Commit-reveal cycle validation
- Winner calculation accuracy
- Prize distribution
- Early exit handling
```

### Priority 2: Testnet Deployment (30 minutes)
```javascript
// Update hardhat.config.ts for Sepolia
// Deploy contracts to testnet
// Verify on Etherscan
// Update frontend with testnet addresses
```

### Priority 3: Documentation (30 minutes)
```markdown
// Update README.md with:
- Installation instructions
- Contract addresses (local + testnet)
- Usage guide
- Academic assignment compliance notes
```
