# Golden Rules - 2/3 Average Game Project Completion

## üéØ Project Completion Principles

- **Focus on Academic Compliance First**  
  Prioritize unit tests, testnet deployment, and documentation over feature additions.

- **2-Hour Sprint Mentality**  
  Every task should directly contribute to project completion. No scope creep.

- **Test-Driven Completion**  
  Write comprehensive tests to validate existing functionality and catch edge cases.

- **Document Everything**  
  Academic assignments require clear explanations of design decisions and implementation choices.

---

## üß™ Testing Standards

- **Comprehensive Smart Contract Testing**  
  Test all functions with success, failure, and edge case scenarios:
  - `GameFactory.test.js`: Factory deployment, game creation, owner controls
  - `TwoThirdsAverageGame.test.js`: Full game lifecycle, security, edge cases

- **Test Structure Consistency**  
  Use descriptive test names: `"should allow player to join with correct entry fee"`

- **Gas Optimization Verification**  
  Include gas usage checks in tests to validate optimization claims.

- **Security Test Coverage**  
  Verify reentrancy protection, access controls, and input validation.

---

## üöÄ Deployment Best Practices

- **Local First, Testnet Second**  
  Always test thoroughly on local Hardhat network before testnet deployment.

- **Environment Security**  
  Never expose private keys or RPC URLs. Use environment variables properly.

- **Contract Verification**  
  Always verify contracts on Etherscan after testnet deployment for transparency.

- **Address Management**  
  Update `Frontend/src/addresses.json` with deployed contract addresses immediately.

---

## üìö Documentation Standards

- **Academic Rigor**  
  Explain WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT was implemented.

- **Installation Clarity**  
  Provide step-by-step instructions that a fellow student could follow.

- **Security Explanation**  
  Document commit-reveal pattern, gas optimizations, and security measures.

- **Compliance Checklist**  
  Verify all professor requirements are satisfied and documented.

---

## üß± Code Quality Maintenance

- **No Breaking Changes**  
  Existing functionality is production-ready. Only add tests and documentation.

- **Preserve Architecture**  
  Follow established patterns: Factory, commit-reveal, pull-over-push withdrawals.

- **TypeScript Compliance**  
  Maintain type safety throughout the codebase.

- **Comment Complex Logic**  
  Especially in smart contracts where gas optimization might obscure readability.

---

## ü§ñ Working with AI for Project Completion

- **Specific Task Requests**  
  "Create GameFactory tests" vs "Help with testing" - be precise.

- **Reference Existing Code**  
  Point to specific files and functions when asking for test implementations.

- **Academic Integrity Focus**  
  Ask for explanations of implementation choices for documentation purposes.

- **Incremental Progress**  
  Complete one test file before moving to the next. Validate each step.

---

## üîê Blockchain-Specific Rules

- **Security First**  
  Never compromise on reentrancy guards, input validation, or access controls.

- **Gas Consciousness**  
  Maintain existing optimizations, document gas costs in tests.

- **Event Verification**  
  Test that all expected events are emitted correctly.

- **Network Consistency**  
  Ensure frontend works on both local and testnet configurations.

## ‚ö° 2-Hour Sprint Protocol

### Hour 1: Testing (Priority 1)
- Create `test/` directory structure
- Implement `GameFactory.test.js` (25 min)
- Implement `TwoThirdsAverageGame.test.js` (30 min)
- Run all tests and fix any issues (5 min)

### Hour 2: Deployment & Documentation (Priority 2 & 3)
- Configure Sepolia testnet (10 min)
- Deploy and verify contracts (20 min)
- Update README with testnet addresses (10 min)
- Final project review and submission prep (20 min)

---

## üéì Academic Submission Guidelines

- **Requirements Checklist**  
  Verify every professor requirement is met and documented.

- **Code Quality**  
  Ensure professional-level code that demonstrates learning.

- **Honest Documentation**  
  Acknowledge any limitations or known issues transparently.

- **Version Control**  
  Commit frequently with clear messages during the completion sprint.

---

## üö® Critical Warnings

- **Don't Modify Core Logic**  
  The game mechanics are working perfectly. Only add tests and deployment.

- **Preserve Security Features**  
  Never remove or weaken existing security measures.

- **Academic Deadline Awareness**  
  Stay focused on submission requirements, not perfect code.

- **Network Configuration**  
  Always verify MetaMask network settings when switching between local and testnet.

---

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done

A task is complete when:
- [ ] All tests pass with good coverage
- [ ] Contracts deployed and verified on testnet  
- [ ] README updated with complete instructions
- [ ] All academic requirements documented
- [ ] Project ready for professor evaluation

**Remember: This is production-ready code. The sprint focuses on academic compliance, not feature development.** üéØ
